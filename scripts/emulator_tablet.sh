# Boots the PixelTablet_API35 emulator and opens scrcpy against it, in one shot.
# See docs/EMULATOR.md for why -gpu host + NVIDIA PRIME offload and
# --render-driver=software are required on this machine's hybrid AMD/NVIDIA
# GPU laptop — without them the emulator segfaults under load (RenderThread
# crash confirmed via dmesg) within 1-2 minutes of boot.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/emulator_tablet.sh
#
# Then in a separate terminal:
#   flutter run -d emulator-5554
